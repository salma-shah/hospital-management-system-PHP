# Care Compass Hospital Website - PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, mySQL

## About
This project is a website for Care Compass Hospital. It allows users to view the services the hospital provides, make registrations for medical tests, book appointments, and search for available doctors. It can be used by different members of the hospital staff, as well, with staff logging into their respective dashboards. Of course, administrators have full control over the data.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP
* mySQL

This was hosted on the localhost WAMP server and coded on Visual Studio Code.

The frontend of the website was built using HTML and a CSS sheet; no template was used, as I wanted to rely solely on my creative skills. JavaScript enabled validation and allowed for pop-up messages on the localhost, providing notifications to the client-side. On the other hand, the backend was built with PHP and integrated with a MySQL database named 'care_compass_hospital'.

## Lessons Learned

* This was my project for my web development module, and the first time I had ever integrated a system with a database.
* Though I was familiar with HTML and CSS, JavaScript and PHP were new to me, and I was given the chance to learn them.
* During the course of this project, I became familiar with methods to hash passwords, like SHA-256 and salting, and became aware of SQL Injection.
* Frontend is not my strong suit, but I did my utmost best in creating the wireframes on Figma using inspirations from similar websites before bringing it to life using HTML and CSS, without any templates, and really pushed myself.
